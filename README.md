# ðŸŽ­ Emotion Detector - Facial Emotion Classification

**Emotion Detector** is a **deep learning** project that classifies people in images as happy or sad using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **OpenCV**. The model is trained on a labelled image dataset that I gathered from google images and achieves high accuracy through convolutional neural networks. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, validation, and testing.

# ðŸ“Š Model Performance
The model was trained on a labeled dataset and achieved the following **loss** and **accuracy**:

I also tested the model on a seperate **testing data set** that the model has not seen before:

**Accuracy**: 1.0/1.0 âœ…

**Precision**: 1.0/1.0 ðŸŽ¯

**Recall**: 1.0/1.0 ðŸ“ˆ
